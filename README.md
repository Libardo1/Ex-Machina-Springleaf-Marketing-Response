# Ex-Machina-Springleaf-Marketing-Response
My code for Kaggle's Springleaf marketing response project. 

I could not spend much time on this project, and this was literally a last minute effort. The project was particularly challenging in that there were around 1934 untagged features about users who responded (or not) to marketing campaigns from Springleaf. 

Springleaf wanted to identify those users who were more likely to respond.

I only had time to submit 4 iterations of my model. The AUC score was 0.77708. I will probably try submitting few more iterations later to see if I can improve the score. Kaggle allows submitting your models after the competition closure, but your public rank will not change. They only inform you of "what could have happened" if you had submitted a model before the competition. Still a great way to learn.
